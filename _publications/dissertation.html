The <em>tree-breadth</em> of a graph is a recently introduced variant of the well known idea of decomposing a graph into a tree of bags.
It is a parameter which adds a metric constraint to tree-decompositions limiting the radius of each bag.
In this dissertation, we further investigate the tree-breadth of graphs.
We present approaches to compute a tree-decomposition with small breadth for a given graph including approximation algorithms for general graphs as well as optimal solutions for special graph classes.
Additionally, we introduce a variant of tree-breadth called <em>strong tree-breadth</em>.
Next, we present various algorithms to approach the (Connected) $r$-Domination problem for graphs with bounded tree-breadth.
One variant, called <em>path-breadth</em>, requires the decomposition to be a path instead of a tree.
We use graphs with bounded path-breadth to construct efficient constant-factor approximation algorithms for the bandwidth and line-distortion problems.
Motivated by these results, we introduce and investigate the new <em>Minimum Eccentricity Shortest Path</em> problem.
We analyse the hardness of the problem, show algorithms to compute an optimal solution, and present approximation algorithms differing in quality and runtime.
