In this paper, we introduce and investigate the <em>Minimum Eccentricity Shortest Path (MESP)</em> problem in unweighted graphs.
It asks for a given graph to find a shortest path with minimum eccentricity.
We demonstrate that:
<ul>
    <li>
        a minimum eccentricity shortest path plays a crucial role in obtaining the best to date approximation algorithm for a minimum distortion embedding of a graph into the line;
    </li>
    <li>
        the MESP-problem is NP-hard on general graphs;
    </li>
    <li>
        a 2-approximation, a 3-approximation, and an 8-approximation for the MESP-problem can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time, in $\mathcal{O}(nm)$ time, and in linear time, respectively;
    </li>
    <li>
        a shortest path of minimum eccentricity&nbsp;$k$ in general graphs can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2k+2}m)$ time;
    </li>
    <li>
        the MESP-problem can be solved in linear time for trees.
    </li>
</ul>
