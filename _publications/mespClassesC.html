We investigate the <em>Minimum Eccentricity Shortest Path</em> problem in some structured graph classes. It asks for a given graph to find a shortest path with minimum eccentricity.
Although it is NP-hard in general graphs, we demonstrate that a minimum eccentricity shortest path can be found in linear time for distance-hereditary graphs (generalizing the previous result for trees) and in $\mathcal{O}(n^3m)$ time for chordal graphs and for dually chordal graphs.
