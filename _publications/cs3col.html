In this paper, we investigate the Colourability problem for dually chordal graphs and some of its generalisations.
We show that the problem remains NP-complete if limited to four colours.
For the case of three colours, we present a simple linear time algorithm for dismantlable graphs (which include dually chordal graphs) and present an $\mathcal{O}(n^3m)$ time algorithm for graphs with tree-breadth&nbsp;1.
Additionally, we show that a dually chordal graph is 3-colourable if and only if it is perfect and has no clique of size four.
