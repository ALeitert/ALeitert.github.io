We say that a given graph $G = (V, E)$ has <em>pathbreadth</em> at most $\rho$, denoted $\mathrm{pb}(G) \leq \rho$, if there exists a Roberston and Seymour's path decomposition where every bag is contained in the $\rho$-neighbourhood of some vertex.
Similarly, we say that $G$ has <em>strong pathbreadth</em> at most $\rho$, denoted $\mathrm{spb}(G) \leq \rho$, if there exists a Roberston and Seymour's path decomposition where every bag is the complete œÅ-neighbourhood of some vertex.
It is straightforward that $\mathrm{pb}(G) \leq \mathrm{spb}(G)$ for any graph $G$.
Inspired from a close conjecture in [Leitert and Dragan, COCOA'16], we prove in this note that $\mathrm{spb}(G) \leq 4 \cdot \mathrm{pb}(G)$.
