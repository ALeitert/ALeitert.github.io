This thesis deals with the Dominating Induced Matching problem for acyclic hypergraphs.
This problem asks for a set of edges so that every edge shares a vertex with exactly one edge of this set.
After dealing with the theoretical background this thesis will show that the problem can be reduced to the Weighted Independent Set problem on the square of the linegraph.
At the end of the thesis some algorithms will be presentetd to solve the problem for several kinds of acyclic hypergraphs in polynomial time.
