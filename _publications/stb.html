In this paper, we introduce and investigate <em>strong tree-breadth</em>.
We say that a graph&nbsp;$G$ has <em>strong tree-breadth&nbsp;$\rho$</em> if there is a tree-decomposition&nbsp;$T$ for&nbsp;$G$ such that each bag&nbsp;$B$ of&nbsp;$T$ is equal to the complete $\rho$-neighbourhood of some vertex&nbsp;$v$ in&nbsp;$G$, i.e., $B = N_G^\rho[v]$.
We will show that it is NP-complete to determine if a given graph has strong tree-breadth&nbsp;$\rho$, even for $\rho = 1$;
if a graph&nbsp;$G$ has strong tree-breadth&nbsp;$\rho$, then we can find a tree-decomposition for&nbsp;$G$ with tree-breadth&nbsp;$\rho$ in $\mathcal{O}(n^2m)$ time;
with some additional restrictions, a tree-decomposition with strong breadth&nbsp;$\rho$ can be found in polynomial time;
some graph classes including distance-hereditary graphs have strong tree-breadth&nbsp;1.
