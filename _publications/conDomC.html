We develop efficient parameterized, with additive error, approximation algorithms for the (Connected) $r$-Domination problem and the (Connected) $p$-Center problem for unweighted and undirected graphs.
Given a graph&nbsp;$G$, we show how to construct a (connected) $\big(r + \mathcal{O}(\mu) \big)$-dominating set&nbsp;$D$ with $|D| \leq |D^*|$ efficiently.
Here, $D^*$ is a minimum (connected) $r$-dominating set of&nbsp;$G$ and $\mu$ is our graph parameter, which is the <em>tree-breadth</em> or the <em>cluster diameter in a layering partition</em> of&nbsp;$G$.
Additionally, we show that a $+ \mathcal{O}(\mu)$-approximation for the (Connected) $p$-Center problem on&nbsp;$G$ can be computed in polynomial time.
Our interest in these parameters stems from the fact that in many real-world networks, including Internet application networks, web networks, collaboration networks, social networks, biological networks, and others, and in many structured classes of graphs these parameters are small constants.
