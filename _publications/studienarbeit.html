This thesis deals with the checking of graphs with the goal of comparing the input of a student with a reference solution for a computerbased modelling task.
Therefore the principle of graph edit distance is threated theoretically and algorithms are be introduced to compute graph edit distance.
Next the algorithms will be tested with the focus on runtime.
In the tests a branch-and-bound-procedure and an evolutionary algorithm yielded the best results.
Also this thesis introduces a concept that allows analysing the input of the student.
