In this paper, we introduce and investigate the <em>Minimum Eccentricity Shortest Path (MESP)</em> problem in unweighted graphs.
It asks for a given graph to find a shortest path with minimum eccentricity.
Let $n$ and $m$ respectively denote the number of vertices and edges of a given graph.
We demonstrate that:
<ul>
    <li>
        a minimum eccentricity shortest path plays a crucial role in obtaining the best to date approximation algorithm for a minimum distortion embedding of a graph into the line;
    </li>
    <li>
        the MESP problem is NP-hard for planar bipartite graphs with maximum degree 3 and W[2]-hard for general graphs;
    </li>
    <li>
        a shortest path of minimum eccentricity $k$ can be computed in $\mathcal{O}\big(n^{2k+2}m\big)$ time;
    </li>
    <li>
        a 2-approximation, a 3-approximation, and an 8-approximation for the MESP problem can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time, in $\mathcal{O}(nm)$ time, and in $\mathcal{O}(m)$ time, respectively;
    </li>
    <li>
        in a graph with a shortest path of eccentricity $k$, a $k$-dominating set can be found in $n^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$ time.
    </li>
</ul>
