We investigate the <em>minimum line-distortion</em> and the <em>minimum bandwidth</em> problems on unweighted graphs and their relations with the <em>minimum length</em> of a Robertson-Seymour's path-decomposition.
The <em>length</em> of a path-decomposition of a graph is the largest diameter of a bag in the decomposition.
The <em>path-length</em> of a graph is the minimum length over all its path-decompositions.
In particular, we show:
(i) if a graph $G$ can be embedded into the line with distortion&nbsp;$k$, then $G$ admits a Robertson-Seymour's path-decomposition with bags of diameter at most $k$ in&nbsp;$G$;
(ii) for every class of graphs with path-length bounded by a constant, there exist an efficient constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum line-distortion problem and an efficient constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum bandwidth problem;
(iii) there is an efficient 2-approximation algorithm for computing the path- length of an arbitrary graph;
(iv) AT-free graphs and some intersection families of graphs have path-length at most 2;
(v) for AT-free graphs, there exist a linear time 8-approximation algorithm for the minimum line-distortion problem and a linear time 4-approximation algorithm for the minimum bandwidth problem.
